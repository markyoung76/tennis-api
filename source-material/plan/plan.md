# BUILDING A TENNIS API WEB PAGE

### To allow the user to search and display information about an ATP or WTA tennis player's statistical data.

## PLAN

1. Look for and research a tennis API that fulfils our requirements and enables us to use a fetch request to retrieve data and display it inside our bespoke tennis stats web build.
2. Once the correct API is sourced, sign-up to use it and get the relevant security key to allow our web page to function properly.
3. Come up with a general design concept for our bespoke web page and create a low-fidelity wireframe to show how the basic design and layout will look, using Excalidraw (VS Code plug-in).
4. Build upon our low-fidelity design by sourcing a suitable colour scheme using the Coolors website to generate a palette. When we are happy with our choices, take a screenshot and include it in the README.md file. Our inspiration for the colour palette stems from the colours associated with Wimbledon AELTC (All England Lawn Tennis Club).
5. Create a suitable high-fidelity wireframe to incorporate the above.
6. Set-up our HTML, CSS and JavaScript files and link everything accordingly to the HTML document, so that it all operates as it should.
7. Create a source material folder and an image subfolder to store all of our wireframe designs and any other artwork that we will be making use of for our web page.
8. Also, create a further subfolder for any planning to be considered and implemented (inside this plan.md file).
9. Start coding. Build-up the HTML & CSS elements to establish a functioning web page.
10. Use semantic HTML and CSS styling to create the header and borders in-line with our original wireframe design.
11. Build the 'stats display area' by importing the tennis court background image and positioning appropriately to the borders.
12. Apply a linear gradient filter on top of the background image to acheieve the desired appearance (as per our Figma wireframe design).
